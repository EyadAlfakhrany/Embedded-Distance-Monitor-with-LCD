# Embedded-Distance-Monitor-with-LCD
This embedded project measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the result on an LCD. When a valid distance is detected, the system controls a stepper motor to rotate in a clockwise direction. The application runs on the **ATmega32** microcontroller and uses several hardware abstraction layers for modularity.
